# Land Use Classification

This project demonstrates a land use classification model using Sentinel 2 data.

Download the whole folder into your desktop and store them in the same parent folder. 
Then you should be able to run the jupyter notebook. 

If you cannot open a jupyter notebook, please install Anaconda in https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

The Python version I use is 3.8.5

## Requirements

You will need conda to load the dependencies

Load the dependencies into your Python 3.x environment:

```shell
conda env create -f=env.yml
```



Optionally, you can create a [Google Earth Engine account](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/), since this project uses Google Earth Engine to retrieve satellite data. For this demo, a cached copy of the data is included, so you do not need to use Earth Engine.
