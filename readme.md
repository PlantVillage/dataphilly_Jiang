# Land Use Classification

This project demonstrates a land use classification model using Sentinel 2 data.



## Requirements

You will need conda to load the dependencies

Load the dependencies into your Python 3.x environment:

```shell
conda env create -f=env.yml
```



Optionally, you can create a [Google Earth Engine account](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/), since this project uses Google Earth Engine to retrieve satellite data. For this demo, a cached copy of the data is included, so you do not need to use Earth Engine.
